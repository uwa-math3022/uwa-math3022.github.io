This page summarises the simple continuum model for single-lane traffic.

<h3 id="speed"><a class="permalink" href="#speed" aria-label="Permalink"></a>Speed vs density</h3>
<p>
With the exception of tailgaters,
drivers tend to go slower when the traffic is denser.
The simplest model is a linear relationship
between the <b>density</b> <span class="js-maths">N</span> (amount of vehicle per length of road)
and the <b>preferred speed</b> <span class="js-maths">V</span>:
</p>
<div class="js-maths important">V = \Vmax \roundbr{1 - \frac{N}{\Nmax}}
</div>
<p>
<img alt="Preferred speed vs density curve" src="preferred-speed.png">
</p>
<ul>
<li>When there is no traffic (<span class="colour-b"><span class="js-maths">N = 0</span></span>),
drivers will go at the speed limit (<span class="colour-b"><span class="js-maths">V = \Vmax</span></span>).
</li>
<li>When there is bumper-to-bumper traffic (<span class="colour-r"><span class="js-maths">N = \Nmax</span></span>),
drivers will halt (<span class="colour-r"><span class="js-maths">V = 0</span></span>).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We also assume that drivers are able to adjust their speed <em>instantly</em>
when the density changes.
This might not seem realistic,
but remember we are constructing a <em>model</em>.
(Also note that in real life,
most drivers are happy to do the speed limit
even when the density <em>isn't</em> zero,
by keeping at a 2-second separation to the vehicle ahead.)
</p>
<h3 id="flux"><a class="permalink" href="#flux" aria-label="Permalink"></a>Flux vs density</h3>
<p>
Traffic engineers generally want to maximise the <b>flux</b> of traffic,
which is the product of density and speed:
</p>
<div class="js-maths important">\begin{aligned}
  F &amp;= N V \\
    &amp;= N \Vmax \roundbr{1 - \frac{N}{\Nmax}}
\end{aligned}
</div>
<p>
<img alt="Carried flux vs density curve" src="carried-flux.png">
</p>
<p>
In our current model this is a parabolic relationship:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximum flux <span class="js-maths">\Fmax = \Nmax \Vmax / 4</span> is obtained
with traffic at <em>half</em> the maximum density going at <em>half</em> the speed limit.
</li>
<li>The flux is <em>zero</em> in both the empty-street case <span class="js-maths">N = 0</span>, <span class="js-maths">V = \Vmax</span>
(because there are no cars)
and in the bumper-to-bumper case <span class="js-maths">N = \Nmax</span>, <span class="js-maths">V = 0</span>
(because the cars aren't moving).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that there are two ways to achieve a given flux <span class="js-maths">F &lt; \Fmax</span>:
<span class="colour-b">fast &amp; sparse</span>, and <span class="colour-r">slow &amp; dense</span>
(with the former being preferable to drivers).

<h3 id="conservation"><a class="permalink" href="#conservation" aria-label="Permalink"></a>Conservation</h3>
<p>
After doing the usual conservation analysis (here, "conservation of vehicle"),
we obtain the continuity equation
</p>
<div class="js-maths">\frac{\pd N}{\pd t} + \frac{\pd F}{\pd x} = 0,
</div>
<p>
and since we have a direct relationship <span class="js-maths">F = F (N)</span> between flux and density,
this becomes the <b>traffic equation</b>
</p>
<div class="js-maths important">\frac{\pd N}{\pd t} + \frac{\td F}{\td N} \frac{\pd N}{\pd x} = 0.
</div>
<h3 id="signal-speed"><a class="permalink" href="#signal-speed" aria-label="Permalink"></a>Signal speed</h3>
<p>
The quantity <span class="js-maths">\td F / {\td N}</span> has dimensions of speed, and varies linearly
from <span class="js-maths">+\Vmax</span> at zero density to <span class="js-maths">-\Vmax</span> at maximum density:
</p>
<div class="js-maths important">\frac{\td F}{\td N} = \Vmax \roundbr{1 - \frac{2N}{\Nmax}}
</div>
<p>
<img alt="Signal speed vs density curve" src="signal-speed.png">
</p>
<p>
It turns out that <span class="js-maths">\td F / {\td N}</span> is the <b>signal speed</b>
for the local density:
</p>
<h2 id="characteristics"><a class="permalink" href="#characteristics" aria-label="Permalink"></a>Method of characteristics</h2>
<span class="js-maths">\gdef \charac #1 {\colv{#1}}</span>
<span class="js-maths">\gdef \xc {x_\mathrm{c}}</span>
<p>
Unlike the heat equation, the traffic equation is a <b>hyperbolic PDE</b>.
Instead of separation of variables, we use the <b>method of characteristics</b>.
</p>
<p>
We seek <span class="colour-v"><b>characteristic curves</b> <span class="js-maths">x = \xc (t)</span></span>
along which the density <span class="js-maths">N (x, t)</span> is constant, i.e.
</p>
<div class="js-maths">N (\charac{\xc (t)}, t) = \const.
</div>
<p>
By definition <span class="js-maths">\td N = 0</span> along a characteristic,
and using the chain rule we have
</p>
<div class="js-maths">\frac{\pd N}{\pd t} + \charac{\frac{\td \xc}{\td t}} \frac{\pd N}{\pd x} = 0.
</div>
<p>
Comparing this with the traffic equation
</p>
<div class="js-maths">\frac{\pd N}{\pd t} + \charac{\frac{\td F}{\td N}} \frac{\pd N}{\pd x} = 0,
</div>
<p>
we see that the characterstics are given by
</p>
<div class="js-maths important">\charac{\frac{\td \xc}{\td t} = \frac{\td F}{\td N}}.
</div>
<p>
Thus the characteristics are straight lines in spacetime
with slope equal to the <b>signal speed</b> <span class="js-maths">\td F / {\td N}</span>.
</p>
<p>
Note that <strong>characteristics are NOT the trajectories of the cars</strong>;
they are curves along which density is constant.
</p>
<h3 id="steps"><a class="permalink" href="#steps" aria-label="Permalink"></a>Steps</h3>
<p>
Given a traffic problem:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Draw a spacetime diagram with position <span class="js-maths">x</span> on the horizontal axis
and time <span class="js-maths">t</span> on the vertical axis.
</li>
<li>Mark the locations in spacetime
where the density <span class="js-maths">N</span> is given by the boundary and initial conditions.
</li>
<li>For a bunch of these locations:
<ol>
<li>Work out the signal speed <span class="js-maths">\td F / {\td N}</span> for the given value of <span class="js-maths">N</span>.
</li>
<li>Draw the associated characteristic curve through this location
(the straight line with slope <span class="js-maths">\td F / {\td N}</span>).
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Since characteristics are curves with constant density <span class="js-maths">N</span>,
this procedure "extends" the boundary/initial values of <span class="js-maths">N</span>
to all of spacetime.
In other words, we've solved for <span class="js-maths">N (x, t)</span>. That's all there is to do.
</p>
<p>
If we wanted to find the actual trajectories <span class="js-maths">x = x (t)</span> of the cars,
we would:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine <span class="js-maths">V (x, t)</span> from <span class="js-maths">N (x, t)</span>
using the <a href="#speed">speed vs density relationship</a>.
</li>
<li>Solve the ODE <span class="js-maths">\td x / {\td t} = V (x, t)</span>.
We could also proceed graphically;
simply sketch the trajectories so that the slope (which is the speed)
matches <span class="js-maths">V (x, t)</span>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Finally, since time is on the vertical axis,
remember that "fast" trajectories are near-horizontal
while "slow" trajectories are near-vertical.
