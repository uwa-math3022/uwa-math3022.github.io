----
Consider a uniform slab of thickness $2L$, [thermal conductivity][k] $k$,
[specific heat capacity][c] $c$, and [density][rho] $\rho$ .
----
----
Suppose the rod is initially at temperature $\TI$ throughout,
and thereafter loses heat to the environment at temperature $\TE$
via [Newtonian cooling][newton] through its two faces,
with a [heat transfer coefficient][h] of $h$.
----
----
What happens?
