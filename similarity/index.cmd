##{#problem} Problem ##

----
Consider an infinite block of [density] $\rho$, [specific heat capacity] $c$,
and [thermal conductivity] $k$.
----
----
Suppose the block is initially at zero temperature throughout.
At time $t = 0$:
----
====
* Cram thermal energy per area $Q$ into the plane $x = 0$
====
----
What happens?

__Q.__
  How can you put a non-zero amount of thermal energy
  into a plane which has zero thickness?
\+
__A.__
  It's an idealisation, like a point charge.
  In the case of a point charge,
  the charge density is infinite but the amount of charge is finite.
  Here, the initial temperature of the plane $x = 0$ is infinite,
  but the energy per area is finite.
