# [uwa-math3022.github.io][site]

Some stuff for MATH3022 Scientific and Industrial Modelling,
at the University of Western Australia (UWA).

PDFs are a pain to read on small screens,
and also equations don't look terribly good on LMS.

Pages are written in a stupid variant of markdown called [CMD].
If you use Windows,
be careful not to run the `.cmd` files by accident;
they might break your computer.
